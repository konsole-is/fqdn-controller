Traditional Kubernetes NetworkPolicy objects do not support rules based on fully qualified domain names (FQDNs).
As a result, teams often resort to installing complex solutions like Cilium, custom VPC CNIs, or service meshes 
introducing operational overhead, additional dependencies, and deeper integration into the cluster network stack.

fqdn-controller addresses this gap by extending Kubernetes with a controller that dynamically resolves FQDNs to IPs 
and maintains them in standard NetworkPolicy objects. It avoids invasive networking changes and works with the default 
CNI, making it suitable for clusters running in the cloud or in environments where simplicity and portability are 
priorities.

## ‚ú® Features

- Create `NetworkPolicy` egress rules based on FQDNs
- Automatically resolve and refresh IPs on a configurable schedule
- Optionally filter private IPs to enforce security policies
- Supports IPv4, IPv6, or both
- Helm chart available via Artifact Hub

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Install cert-manager CRDs** (for webhooks):

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/latest/download/cert-manager.crds.yaml
   ```

2. Install fqdn-controller CRDs

   ```bash
   curl -sL https://github.com/konsole-is/fqdn-controller/releases/<version>/download/crds.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
    ```

### Helm installation

```bash
helm repo add konsole https://konsole-is.github.io/fqdn-controller/charts
helm repo update
helm install fqdn-controller konsole/fqdn-controller --version 0.1.0
```

### Kubectl installation

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/konsole-is/fqdn-controller/releases/<version>/download/fqdn-controller.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Note: Will contain only 1 replica unless modified.

| `blockPrivateIPs`       | Whether to exclude RFC1918/private IPs from resolved results              |
| `enabledNetworkType`    | IP address type to allow: one of `ipv4`, `ipv6`, or `all`. Default: `all` |
